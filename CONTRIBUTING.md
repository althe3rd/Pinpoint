# Contributing to UW Accessibility Checker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the UW Accessibility Checker project! This tool helps University of Wisconsin faculty and staff ensure their digital content meets accessibility standards.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Provide easy-to-use accessibility testing for UW faculty and staff
- Deliver consistent results using industry-standard axe-core
- Maintain professional UW branding and standards
- Support local development and testing workflows

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter problems with the bookmarklet:

1. **Check existing issues** in the GitHub Issues tab
2. **Test on multiple browsers** and websites to isolate the problem
3. **Use the local test page** (`local-test.html`) to verify if it's a general issue
4. **Provide detailed information** when reporting:
   - Browser version and operating system
   - Website where the issue occurred
   - Steps to reproduce the problem
   - Any error messages from the browser console (F12)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for improving the tool:

1. **Search existing feature requests** to avoid duplicates
2. **Consider the target audience** (UW faculty and staff)
3. **Align with accessibility best practices** and WCAG standards
4. **Maintain compatibility** with the axe-core ecosystem

### Code Contributions

#### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Understanding of web accessibility principles
- Familiarity with axe-core (helpful but not required)

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TestMark.git
   cd TestMark
   ```

3. **Start a local server** for testing:
   ```bash
   # Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

4. **Open the test environment**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/local-test.html
   ```

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following these guidelines:
   - **Keep it simple**: The tool should be easy to use for non-technical users
   - **Maintain UW branding**: Use the established color scheme and styling
   - **Test thoroughly**: Verify changes work across different browsers and websites
   - **Follow accessibility best practices**: The tool itself should be accessible

3. **Test your changes**:
   - Use `local-test.html` for functionality testing
   - Test the bookmarklet on various websites
   - Verify the interface works with keyboard navigation
   - Check that styling remains consistent

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

#### Code Style Guidelines

- **HTML**: Use semantic HTML5 elements
- **CSS**: Follow BEM methodology where applicable
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Use ES5 syntax for broader browser compatibility in bookmarklets
  - Use `var` instead of `let`/`const` in bookmarklet code
  - Use traditional `function()` instead of arrow functions in bookmarklets
  - Comment complex logic clearly

## üß™ Testing

### Required Testing

Before submitting changes:

1. **Local functionality test**: Use `local-test.html`
2. **Cross-browser testing**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
3. **Real-world testing**: Test on various websites (university sites, news sites, etc.)
